# InfinityOS
InfinityOS - Simplest Operating System Kernel

## Small Two Stage Bootloader and C Kernel

I know a lot about 16 real mode and boot sectors but not everything about it. I
am doing this small project to learn even more, after all knowledge is power. This
project will show you how to write a two stage boot loader written in NASM (Net-wide Assembler), also with a simple kernel
written in pure C.
