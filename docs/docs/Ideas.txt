kmem_flags SOLARIS EXAMPLE
AUDIT    0x1   The allocator maintains a log that contains recent history of its activity. The number of items logged depends on whether CONTENTS is also set. The log is a fixed size and when space is exhausted, earlier records are reclaimed.
TEST     0x2   The allocator writes a pattern into freed memory and checks that the pattern is unchanged when the buffer is next allocated. If some portion of the buffer is changed, this indicates that the memory was probably used by an entity that had previously allocated and freed the buffer. If an overwrite is seen, the system panics.
REDZONE  0x4   The allocator provides extra memory at the end of the requested buffer and inserts a special pattern into that memory. When the buffer is freed, the pattern is checked to see if data was written past the end of the buffer. If an overwrite is seen, the kernel panics.
CONTENTS 0x8   The allocator logs up to 256 bytes of buffer contents when the buffer is freed. Requires that AUDIT also be set. The numeric value of these flags can be logically added (OR'ed) together and set by the /etc/system file in the Solaris 8 release, or for previous releases, by booting kadb and setting the flags before starting the kernel.
LITE     0x100 Does minimal sanity checking when a buffer is allocated and freed. When enabled, the allocator checks that the redzone has not been written into, that a freed buffer is not being freed again, and that the buffer being freed is the size that was allocated. This flag is available as of the Solaris 7 3/99 release. Do not combine this flag with any other flags.
